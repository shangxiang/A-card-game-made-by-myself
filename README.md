# A-card-game-made-by-myself
I want to retro the card game fgo in my way, but during the process I changed my mind and want to have my own card game.

the version of python is python3.5 and you need to install pygame at first.
resource1 contains all of the .png files used in this program.
test1.py is the newest version of this program.
